Ployglot,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Fitness functions introduced by <a href=""/radar/techniques/evolutionary-architecture"">evolutionary architecture</a>, borrowed from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation#:%7E:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20evolutionary%20computation,soft%20computing%20studying%20these%20algorithms."">evolutionary computing</a>, are executable functions that inform us if our applications and architecture are objectively moving away from their desired characteristics. They're essentially tests that can be incorporated into our release pipelines. One of the major characteristics of an application is the freshness of its dependencies to other libraries, APIs or environmental components that a <strong>dependency drift fitness function</strong> tracks to flag the out-of-date dependencies that require updating. With the growing and maturing number of tools that detect dependency drifts, such as <a href=""/radar/tools/dependabot"">Dependabot</a> or <a href=""/radar/tools/snyk"">Snyk</a>, we can easily incorporate dependency drift fitness functions into our software release process to take timely action in keeping our application dependencies up to date.</p>"
